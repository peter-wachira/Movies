ðŸ‘€  This project shows how to effectively apply modular clean architecture approach and dependency injection using dagger.

 ## Project characteristics

This project brings to table set of best practices, tools, and solutions:

* 100% Kotlin
* Model-View-View Model Architecture
* Android Jetpack
- [x] Testing
* Dependency Injection
* Material design

## Tech-stack

* Tech-stack
    * [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
    * [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - perform background operations.
    * [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - a type-safe REST client for Android.
    * [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
        * [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - a persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.
        * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - is an observable data holder.
        * [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - perform action when lifecycle state changes.
        * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.

* Architecture
    * MVVM - Model View View Model
* Gradle
    * Plugins 
        * [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/gh/) - a Code Coverage Library
* CI/CD
    * CircleCI
